# 1. TOKENIZATION
# ===============
# Converting text to numbers that computers can work with

def simple_tokenization_example():
    """Show how text becomes numbers"""
    text = "hello world"
    
    # Method 1: Character-level
    char_vocab = {'h': 0, 'e': 1, 'l': 2, 'o': 3, ' ': 4, 'w': 5, 'r': 6, 'd': 7}
    char_tokens = [char_vocab[ch] for ch in text]
    print(f"Text: '{text}'")

    word_vocab = {'hello': 0, 'world': 1}
    word_tokens = [word_vocab[word] for word in text.split()]
    print(f"Word tokens: {word_tokens}")

# 2. NEURAL NETWORK BASICS
# ========================
# How neural networks learn patterns

def neural_network_concept():
    """Explain what a neural network does"""
    print("\nNeural Network Concept:")
    print("Input (numbers) -> Hidden Layers (learn patterns) -> Output (predictions)")
    print("Example: [1,2,3] -> [pattern detection] -> [probability of next number being 4]")

# 3. TRAINING PROCESS
# ==================
# How models learn from data

def training_concept():
    """Explain the training process"""
    print("\nTraining Process:")
    print("1. Show model lots of examples: 'hello' -> 'world'")
    print("2. Model makes predictions: 'hello' -> 'xyz' (wrong at first)")
    print("3. Calculate error: how wrong was the prediction?")
    print("4. Adjust model weights to reduce error")
    print("5. Repeat millions of times until model gets good")

# 4. KEY COMPONENTS OF LANGUAGE MODELS
# ===================================

        self.components = {
            "Tokenizer": "Converts text to numbers and back",
            "Embeddings": "Turn token numbers into rich vector representations", 
            "Attention": "Helps model focus on relevant parts of input",
            "Transformer Layers": "Process and transform the information",
            "Output Layer": "Converts processed info back to token probabilities"

        print("\nLanguage Model Components:")
        for component, description in self.components.items():
            print(f"- {component}: {description}")

# 5. WHY MODELS WORK
# =================

def why_models_work():
    """Explain the intuition behind why language models work"""
    print("\nWhy Language Models Work:")
    print("1. Language has patterns: 'The cat sat on the ___' -> likely 'mat'")
    print("2. Neural networks are good at finding patterns in data")
    print("3. With enough examples, they learn grammar, facts, reasoning")
    print("4. Attention mechanism helps them understand context")
    print("5. Large scale + good architecture = emergent abilities")

# 6. SIMPLE TRAINING EXAMPLE
# ==========================

def simple_training_example():
    """Show a super simple training scenario"""
    print("\nSimple Training Example:")
    
    # Training data
    examples = [
        ("good morning", "how are you"),
        ("good afternoon", "how are you"), 
        ("good evening", "how are you"),

        print(f"  Input: '{input_text}' -> Expected: '{expected_output}'")
    
    print("\nAfter training, model learns:")
    print("- When someone greets, respond with 'how are you'")
    print("- Pattern recognition: greetings -> polite response")

# 7. SCALING UP
# ============

def scaling_concept():
    """Explain how simple models become powerful like Claude"""
    print("\nScaling to Claude-like Models:")
    print("1. Same basic principles, but MUCH larger:")
    print("   - Billions of parameters instead of thousands")
    print("   - Trained on millions of books, websites, conversations")
    print("   - More sophisticated architecture (transformers)")
    print("2. Emergent abilities appear at scale:")
    print("   - Reasoning, creativity, coding, analysis") 
    print("   - These aren't explicitly programmed - they emerge!")
    print("3. Fine-tuning with human feedback makes them helpful & safe")
